               <div class="box4"><span class="p4"><span style="color: #0f0;">Reverse engineering</span> is at the core of what I'm interested in; taking something apart to find out exactly how it was made on the lowest level really interests me, and is why I'm learning assembly language. I hope to use reverse engineering in my career, hopefully dealing with malware analysis.</span></div>
